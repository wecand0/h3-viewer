A number of options in CMake can be set when compiling the H3 core library. These are relevant for building
different ways of using and testing the library and do not affect the underlying algorithms.

When configuring with CMake, an option may be specified using `-D` on the command line, like so for setting
`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Boolean options should be set to `ON` or `OFF`, like so:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
```

## AUDIT_SOURCE_FILE_LIST

Whether to glob the list of source files and compare it to the `ALL_SOURCE_FILES` and `EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILES` lists
defined in CMake. This is a quality control measure to ensure that the source file list in `CMakeLists.txt` actually
matches the sources in the repository and is not missing any files.

## BUILD_ALLOC_TESTS

Whether to build the parts of the [test suite](./testing) that exercise the [H3_ALLOC_PREFIX](./custom-alloc) feature.

## BUILD_BENCHMARKS

Whether to build the [benchmark suite](./testing#benchmarks).

## BUILD_COUNTRY_BENCHMARKS

Whether to build benchmarks that use [Natural Earth](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/) geometries.

The geometries will be downloaded at build time using Node.

## BUILD_FILTERS

Whether to build the [H3 command line filter](./filters) executables.

## BUILD_GENERATORS

Whether to build generator executables used in the development of H3. This is not required for
building the library as the output of these generators is checked in.

## BUILD_TESTING

Whether to build the [test suite](./testing).

## BUILD_FUZZERS

Whether to build the [fuzzer suite](./testing#fuzzers).

## ENABLE_LIBFUZZER

Whether to build the fuzzers with [libFuzzer](https://www.llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) (this expects to be used with Clang). If OFF, a `main` function suitable for use with [American fuzzy lop](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) is included.

## CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

Should be set to `Release` for production builds, and `Debug` in development.

## ENABLE_COVERAGE

Whether to compile `Debug` builds with coverage instrumentation (compatible with GCC, Clang, and lcov). This also excludes defensive code in the library that should not be counted against coverage because it is unreachable.

## ENABLE_DOCS

Whether to build the Doxygen documentation. This is not the same as the [H3 website](https://github.com/uber/h3/tree/master/website),
but is rather the documentation for the internal C library functions.

## ENABLE_FORMAT

Whether to enable using clang-format-14 to format source files before building. This should be enabled
before submitting patches for H3 as continuous integration will fail if the formatting does not match.

Only this version of clang-format should be used to format the sources as new releases of clang-format
can change defaults, causing unintended churn of source code formatting.

## ENABLE_LINTING

Whether to enable using clang-tidy to lint source files when building. Only invoked when
[Makefile or Ninja CMake generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html)
are used.

## H3_ALLOC_PREFIX

Used for directing the library to use a [different set of functions for memory management](./custom-alloc).

## H3_PREFIX

Used for [renaming the public API](./usage#function-renaming).

## PRINT_TEST_FILES

If enabled, CMake will print which CTest test case corresponds to which input file.

## ENABLE_WARNINGS

Whether to enable all compiler warnings. (i.e. [`-Wall`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wall))

## WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS

Whether to treat compiler warnings as errors. While a useful tool for ensuring software quality, this should not be enabled
for production builds as compiler warnings can change unexpectedly between versions. This is intended to be used with
`ENABLE_WARNINGS` on.

## WRAP_VALGRIND

Whether to wrap invocations of the test suite with `valgrind` (if available).
